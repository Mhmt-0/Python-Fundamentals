# The For Loop function is one of the important functions for python. This loop is basically a loop used in programming languages to run a block of code a certain number of times and in a row. The number of repetitions can be changed by interfering with the variable used at the beginning of the cycle within the cycle. It is the most commonly used cycle along with the While cycle.

# There are some important structures located from the for loop loop. These are: "in" & "not in" is also the range() function.

# The range() function is a structure that is often used with for loop.

# Remember that when an argument is given in the range, the given argument runs up to "n-1" if we accept "n".Also, in the same scenario, range started from zero by default. Range will always start from zero by default unless we say otherwise.
