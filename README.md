# Python-Fundamentals

IF-ELIF-ELSE
# How can we use the 'If' in Pyhton:
# If the result of the concept presented as a condition returns a true value in the boolean data type, it enters the structure and executes the code blocks in it.

# How can we use the 'Else' in Python:
# If all the conditions we have specified in advance have not been fulfilled, we specify what Python should do by writing this statement. A condition is not written after this expression.
  
    
# How can we use the 'Elıf' in Python:
# If the result after checking the first “if” condition is “false”, we use the “elif” block structure to prevent the program from entering the “else” block directly and to ensure that it is also queried by different control structures.

    
# In this example you see above, we asked the user to write us a number. We have written the condition that the number to be defined by the code below is positive if it is greater than zero; if it is small, it is a negative number. However, if the user chooses the number he entered as zero, we specified that zero is not negative or positive using else.
