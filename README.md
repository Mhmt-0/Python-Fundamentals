# Python-Fundamentals

IF-ELIF-ELSE
# How can we use the 'If' in Pyhton:
# If the result of the concept presented as a condition returns a true value in the boolean data type, it enters the structure and executes the code blocks in it.

# How can we use the 'Else' in Python:
# If all the conditions we have specified in advance have not been fulfilled, we specify what Python should do by writing this statement. A condition is not written after this expression.
  
    
# How can we use the 'Elıf' in Python:
# If the result after checking the first “if” condition is “false”, we use the “elif” block structure to prevent the program from entering the “else” block directly and to ensure that it is also queried by different control structures.

    
# In this example you see above, we asked the user to write us a number. We have written the condition that the number to be defined by the code below is positive if it is greater than zero; if it is small, it is a negative number. However, if the user chooses the number he entered as zero, we specified that zero is not negative or positive using else.


FOR LOOP
# The For Loop function is one of the important functions for python. This loop is basically a loop used in programming languages to run a block of code a certain number of times and in a row. The number of repetitions can be changed by interfering with the variable used at the beginning of the cycle within the cycle. It is the most commonly used cycle along with the While cycle.

# There are some important structures located from the for loop loop. These are: "in" & "not in" is also the range() function.

# The range() function is a structure that is often used with for loop.

# Remember that when an argument is given in the range, the given argument runs up to "n-1" if we accept "n".Also, in the same scenario, range started from zero by def
